# CVE-2017-8012

In EMC ViPR SRM, Storage M&R, VNX M&R, and M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs, the Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol used to communicate between components in the Alerting and/or Compliance components can be leveraged to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. Attackers with knowledge of JMX agent user credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files on the affected system and create a DoS condition by leveraging inherent JMX protocol capabilities.
