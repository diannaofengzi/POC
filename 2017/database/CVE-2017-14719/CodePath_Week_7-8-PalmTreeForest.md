  - [ ] Steps to recreate: If an attacker has managed to gain access to an Admin account, they can click on the "Plugins" button and view installed plugins. Next to each plugin listed is a "Delete" button, which when pressed, will take the attacker to a page where the Admin is able to view the contents of the directory that he/she is trying to delete before making a permanent change. From this page, the attacker can delete the name of the plugin from the URL (located directly after checked[0]= and before the '&'). The attacker replaces the plugin name with one or more " ../ " characters until they have reached the particular directory they would like to delete.

  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Copy exploit code that the very nice hacker called leonjza posted to exploit-db.com (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41223). Save the copied code into a .py file. At the command line, change to the directory where you saved your exploit and run 'python [exploit_file_name].py http://wpdistillery.vm'. I then created a text file with the content I wanted to inject into the WordPress site. I injected this content by running 'python [exploit_file_name].py http://wpdistillery.vm [Post ID] [path to content being injected].txt'. I then went back to my browser and reloaded the page, and saw that my content injection was successful.
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.7/src/wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-attachments-controller.php


## Assets

I used python exploit code from this url: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41223

## Resources

- [WordPress Source Browser](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/)
- [WordPress Developer Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/)


## Notes

While working on the 'Unauthenticated Page/Post Content Modification via REST API' I encountered an import error for the python file due to not having the lxml package installed. 
After installing lxml, I tried to run 'python [exploit_file_name].py http://wpdistillery.vm' again. This is where I ran into my second problem: I received a UnicodeEncodeError. I solved this problem by deleting extraneous posts which contained the ordinal that was not in range.

I made a new post with plain text content and ran the script again. It executed successfully, discovering the API endpoints and getting the available post id, title, and link.
