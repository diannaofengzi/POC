# CVE-2007-0160

Stack-based buffer overflow in the LiveJournal support (hooks/ljhook.cc) in CenterICQ 4.9.11 through 4.21.0, when using unofficial LiveJournal servers, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by adding the victim as a friend and using long (1) username and (2) real name strings. Failed exploitation attempts will likely result in a denial-of-service condition.
