# RCE-CVE-2020-5902
BIG-IP F5 Remote Code Execution

# Description

These attacks are targeting BIG-IP, a multi-purpose networking device manufactured by F5 Networks. BIG-IP devices can be configured to work as traffic shaping systems, load balancers, firewalls, access gateways, rate limiters, or SSL middleware.

On Wednesday, F5 Networks published patches and released a security advisory about a "remote code execution" vulnerability in BIG-IP devices.

F5 said the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-5902, could allow attackers to take full control over unpatched systems that are accessible on the internet.
