# OpenSSL-src Heap Memory Corruption with RSA Private Key Operation : CVE-2022-2274

# Summary

[OpenSSL-src-rust](https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-src-rs) is a source code and logic to build OpenSSL from source written in rust and packaged as a crate. There are currently two maintained branches, matching the two [maintained OpenSSL versions](https://www.openssl.org/policies/releasestrat.html) which are `main` which builds OpenSSL 3.0 and `release/111` which builds OpenSSL 1.1.1.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using 2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.

This vulnerability made building OpenSSL version 3.0 using [openssl-src-rust](https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-src-rs) to fail and crash in the process on the machine supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64 architecture.

# Product

**openssl-src**([Rust](https://github.com/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

# Tested Version

**>= 300.0.8, < 300.0.9**

# Details
## Issue: openssl-src 300.0.8 heap memory corruption with RSA private key operation `(GHSA-735f-pg76-fxc4)`

The processes to reproduce the error or crash are as follow:

Build OpenSSL-3.0.4 on a CPU with AVX512 (this demonstration uses a Core i7-1065G7) with:

    CFLAGS="-O3 -g -fsanitize=address" ./config
    make

Run a test:

    make V=1 TESTS=test_exp test

The sanitizer complains:

It has been proposed by the discoverer of the issue that previous [commits](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18510/commits) to the OpenSSL code might have introduced the bug. The commit was to fix `BN_mod_exp_consttime` so it does not produce unreduced result. The `bn_reduce_once_in_place` function caused the heap memory corruption. 

[crypto/bn/rsaz_exp_x2.c](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18510/files#diff-854689acd04b8f1b65120880bebcd98d519e89b601328820f276ec0e5c164c4f)

This was fixed with an update found in this [commit](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18626/commits) which stated that `bn_reduce_once_in_place` expects the number of `BN_ULONG`, but `factor_size` is moduli bit size. This update was included in the OpenSSL 3.0.5 released in October 12, 2022.

## Impact

An attacker could theoretically exploit this vulnerability by sending a transmission across a network (e.g., a TCP/IP network). A successful exploit could result to:

- Disrupt services (i.e., DoS);
- Steal information in memory (i.e., confidentiality breach);
- Alter information in memory (i.e., integrity breach);
- Invoke/execute a definable list of specific actions on the target application/host;
- Invoke/execute arbitrary commands/code on the target application/host.
## Patches
- Users of the OpenSSL 3.0.4 version should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.5 and above.
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.
