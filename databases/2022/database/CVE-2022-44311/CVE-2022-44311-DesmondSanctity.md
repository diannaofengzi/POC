# Out-Of-Bounds Read in html2xhtml : CVE-2022-44311

# Summary

[Html2xhtml](https://github.com/jfisteus/html2xhtml) v1.3 was discovered to contain an Out-Of-Bounds read in the function static void elm_close(tree_node_t *nodo) at procesador.c. This vulnerability allows attackers to access sensitive files or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted html file.

[**CWE-125 Out-of-Bounds Read**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) is a type of software error that can occur when reading data from memory. This can happen if the program tries to read beyond the end of an array, for example. Out of bounds reads can lead to crashes or other unexpected vulnerabilities, and may allow an attacker to read sensitive information that they should not have access to. 

# Product

## html2xhtml

# Tested Version

## 1.3

# Details
## Issue: Out of Bounds Read in `html2xhtml/src/procesador.c`. `(GHSA-28fm-qh2h-3mch)`

Html2xhtml is a command-line tool that converts HTML files to XHTML files. Html2xhtml can generate the XHTML output compliant to one of the following document types: XHTML 1.0 (Transitional, Strict and Frameset), XHTML 1.1, XHTML Basic and XHTML Mobile Profile.

The vulnerability was discovered due to a segfault error that occured when using the `-t frameset` option. A [segmentation fault or segfault](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346806/what-is-a-segmentation-fault) is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that does not belong to you. It’s a helper mechanism that keeps you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs.

With the use of [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/), a tool for finding memory access errors to heap memory (memory that is dynamically allocated with new or malloc) in C and C++ programs, the segfault error was debugged and it reported an `invalid read of size 4` in the test case:

The error log from [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) led us to the following function where the segfault occured:

[https://github.com/jfisteus/html2xhtml/blob/ffb2f1f12910eb5945413e0bdb9272b508241aa1/src/procesador.c#L940](https://github.com/jfisteus/html2xhtml/blob/ffb2f1f12910eb5945413e0bdb9272b508241aa1/src/procesador.c#L940)

It was found that there is a missing type check in the function. The user was passing a node of type `comment` instead of `element` to the function and this results to out of bound read error. A user could provide a malformed document with an invalid `ELM_PTR(nodo).contenttype[doctype]`, resulting in the following comparison in assembly:


    cmp    dword ptr [rbp + rax*4 + 0xc], 4

This vulnerability can be leveraged by attackers to read sensitive files, memory or locations using a doctored file.

## Impact
- This issue can be leveraged by attackers to read sensitive memory, locations or files.
- Attackers can also cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via a crafted html file.
## Patches
- This vulnerabilty affects any user using any of the packaged version of the software. There is a fix linked to this [commit](https://github.com/jfisteus/html2xhtml/commit/9523db7834bd677276aa2d1db0ffea16755d6331) in the master branch of the github repository for the software. 
- Users are advised to pull the recent updates to the package dated **October 25, 2022 or later** and compile on their machine. There is no new release or versioning after the bug fix.
