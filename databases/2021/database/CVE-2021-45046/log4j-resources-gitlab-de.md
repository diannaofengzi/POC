## ❔ About the vulnerability

Apache Log4j, versions 2.0-2.14.1 have a vulnerability to remote code execution (RCE). It is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., attackers may exploit it over a network without the need for a username and password.

New vulnverabilities have been discovered and fixed, see _Software updates_ below for the timeline.

### 📦 Software updates

Upgrade log4j to the latest release to fix the vulnerabilities.

- [log4j 2.17.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.17.0) fixes [CVE-2021-45105](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-45105), where log4j does not always protect from infinite recursion, leading to DoS attacks.
- [log4j 2.16.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.16.0) removes support for message lookups, and disables JNDI by default. Fixes [CVE-2021-45046](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-45046) with raised critical severity, RCE possibility. 
- [log4j 2.15.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.15.0) fixes the vulnerability in [CVE-2021-44228](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html#CVE-2021-44228) but left JNDI lookups enabled by default.

## 🛡️ Mitigating the vulnerability

The best way to mitigate the vulnerability is to update any application using Log4j to the latest version (see _Software Updates_ section above).  However, there have been many other discussions of how to mitigate the vulnerability short of that.

- Disable message lookups.  These are availabe in Log4j 2.10 - 2.14.1 and requires restarting the process.
  - Adding `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to processes running Log4j 2.10 - 2.14.1.  
  - Setting an environmental variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`
- For versions 2.0-beta9 to 2.10.0, you could remove the JndiLookup class by running the code below and restarting the process
  - `zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
- Without restarting the process, you could apply this [hot patch](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) which injects a Java agent into running processes to patch the issue.
