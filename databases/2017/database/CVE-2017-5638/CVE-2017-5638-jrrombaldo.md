# CVE-2017-5638

This script is intended to validate Apache Struts 2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638), AKA Struts-Shock. This is a completely harmless as it does not inject any malicious payload, only inject an HTTP header named 'STRUTS2-VALIDATION' in order to be able to validate whether is vulnerable

Because of its multithread capability, it's able to run 2.5k+ applications spread around the globe in less than 10 minutes. So, it can be very handy to validate enterprise applications in large scale.


## Usage
There are two ways to run this script, with and without threading, the only difference will the execution time. To enable the threading feature, just need to pass the thread parameter.
The first parameter must be a TXT file containing all targeted URL, one per line. Please note that these URL should be complete, for example, ```https://target.com/admin/myStrutsPage.action```


Here is a usage example without threading:
```python
struts-shock-validation.py target_urls.txt
```

Now using threads capability:
```python
struts-shock-validation.py target_urls.txt thread
```


## Results
it will automatically create a folder called results, and on each execution will create a dated folder containing the execution outcome. If threading is enabled, it will create on file per thread named thread_<number>, which can be ignored because when it completes it will consolidate all threads result on single TXT file with the same name (date/timestamp) as its execution folder.
