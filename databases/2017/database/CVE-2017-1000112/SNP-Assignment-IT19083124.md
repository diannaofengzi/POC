# SNP-Assignment
Exploit work Privilege Escalation CVE-2017-1000112
as the privilege escalation is the mile stone of an attakers view,i try to do a little research on loval privilege escalation which is the basic step of whole privilege escalation unit. while im reading some articles 2016 and 2017 are the years with most no of privilege escalation reports on local and also remote. so i did try to exploit a vulurability with my knowledge with the help of intrnet to understand how these exploits happened not even by a n expert attaker. in the linux os system because of the open source , i can understant what is realy happening, and the teminal can directly run any c program which written by us. i searched for a vulnurebility which use c program and i found one which is easy to gain root access by running the program. all i need is to write a perfect c program and run it.
