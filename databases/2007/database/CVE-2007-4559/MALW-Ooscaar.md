## Readme

# CVE-2007-4559 - Polemarch exploit 
Full working exploit for Polemarch server https://www.polemarch.org/, using CVE-2007-4559, allowing:

- Injection of a cryptominer for monero using TOR for better hiding.
- Injection of a rootkit targeting most common sysadmin tools.


## POC
Proof of concept using https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4559 
and based on the work from https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html.

### Directories to attack
We want to be able to deploy the following files into a Polemarch server:

- /usr/local/lib
  - -> **rootkit.so**: library to do the preloading
- /etc
  - -> **ld.so.preload**: loader configuration file
- /opt/polemarch/bin
  - -> **polemarchctl**: infected docker entry point
- /usr/bin
  - -> **xmring**: miner
  - -> **tor**: tor
  - -> **shellcode**: obfuscated shellcode responsible for starting the miner and tor

Note: in the real exploit we would change some names to avoid detection.

### Notes
- Binary files MUST have executable permissions
- Tar's can not be deployed twice
- Malware will be placed in an auxiliar folder which will be symlinked to target folder

## Instructions
In order to deploy the malware we will have to set up the following:

- Compilation of necessary binaries
- Set up Polemarch server and malicious server hosting infected tar
- Upload infected tar into Polemarch server

## Compile binaries

We will need to compile the rootkit shared library and the shellcode:

```bash
$(rootkit): make
$(shellcode): gcc -z execstack -m32 -o shellcode shell.c
```

## Polemarch server and malicious server

We have created a docker-compose which will:

- Set up a vulnerable Polemarch server at http://localhost:8080
- Generate an infected tar with all the necessary files
- Set up an auxiliary python server hosting the malicous tar at http://energyplus.com/project.tar.gz (only accessible from the docker)

```bash
$: docker compose build 
$: docker compose up -d
```

## Upload infected tar
Log in to the polemarch server using default password (admin/admin) and
create a project with the compromised tar file:

Now, next time the docker is `restarted`, the miner and tor will be executed into the polemarh server.
