# CVE-2020-3574

A vulnerability in the TCP packet processing functionality of Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the phone to stop responding to incoming calls, drop connected calls, or unexpectedly reload. The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP ingress packet rate limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact operations of the phone or cause the phone to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
