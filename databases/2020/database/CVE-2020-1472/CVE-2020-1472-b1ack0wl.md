# CVE-2020-1472 POC
Requires the latest impacket from [GitHub](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) with added netlogon structures. 

Do note that by default this changes the password of the domain controller account. Yes this allows you to DCSync, but it also breaks communication with other domain controllers, so be careful with this!

## Installing
Only works on **Python 3.6 and newer**! If your OS comes installed with impacket (such as Kali), make sure to remove all existing installations first. If you still get import errors after this, run it from a *virtualenv* or *pipenv*.

- Run `cve-2020-1472-full-exploit.py` with IP and netbios name of DC
