# Adobe Acrobat Reader Heap Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

# Vulnerability

Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer Vulnerability


# Vulnerability Description

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the processing of unicode strings. When parsing, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
