# CVE-2018-5354
# ANIXIS Password Reset Client Privilege Escalation/RCE

## Information
**Vendor:** ANIXIS  
**Product:** ANIXIS Password Reset Client  
**Versions Affected:** Before version 3.22  
**Researcher:** Jason Juntunen aka @missing0x00 (https://github.com/missing0x00)  
**CVSS:** 8.8

## Description
The custom GINA/CP module in ANIXIS Password Reset Client before version 3.22 allows remote attackers to execute code and escalate privileges via spoofing.
When the client is configured to use HTTP, it does not authenticate the intended server before opening a browser window. An unauthenticated attacker capable of conducting a spoofing attack can redirect the browser to gain execution in the context of the WinLogon.exe process. If Network Level Authentication is not enforced, the vulnerability can be exploited via RDP.

### Proof of Concept
1. Conduct spoofing attack using any available method (ARP, physical access, etc.), redirecting traffic intended for the intended password reset server
2. Run web server on attacking host, serving binary junk file named pwreset
3. RDP to target host (if NLA is not enforced - otherwise this attack requires physical access)
4. Click "Reset Password" link or tile on logon screen
5. Built-in client browser will be redirected to web server on attacking host, opening File Download dialog
6. Click Save, opening File Explorer dialog
7. Shift+Right-Click > "Open command window here"

### Remediation
Update the client software on all affected devices. This vulnerability was fixed in the client version 3.22 (January 29, 2018). Additionally, ensure that the server and client are configured to use HTTPS with a valid certificate.
