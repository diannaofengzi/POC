# CVE-2019-8372

The LHA.sys driver before 1.1.1811.2101 in LG Device Manager exposes functionality that allows low-privileged users to read and write arbitrary physical memory via specially crafted IOCTL requests and elevate system privileges. This occurs because the device object has an associated symbolic link and an open DACL.
