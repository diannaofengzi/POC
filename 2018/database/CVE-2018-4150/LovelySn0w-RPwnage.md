## Readme

# LovelySn0w.
a iOS CVE-2018-4150 Application example. if this doesn't compile in XCode please message me on twitter. it's probably my fault then! it's not completetd at the moment. if you find 
```javascript
//ACPV ›(Some version) [...]
```
 you are here from the PS4-Scene, waiting for me to finish my work on the PS4 exploits, please read the "To the PS4-Scene" section.
in the exploit.m file, the app will be ready for serious testing. That means that it does something to the file system. like extracting a .tar file to a specific folder. For those which don't get what i mean by that:
no, it's not a zip-app-free thing which extracts a .tar for you. it takes a file from the project and extracts for example, cydia.tar to /Applications. you might get it now..... or not.

# Current State.

**Compiles** = Yes (read text above)
**runs** = No
**Final-Version** = No


# Things, which have to be said.

please don't call this any kind of jailbreak, as it really isn't.

# To the PS4-Scene.

I'm really sorry for this big delay in the release, again. it might take some extra weeks if i decide to primary work on this project. no, i won't give out any kind of eta. but trust me, it will come out sooner than you think
