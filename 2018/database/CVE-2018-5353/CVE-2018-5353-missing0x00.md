# CVE-2018-5353
# Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfServicePlus Client Privilege Escalation/RCE

## Information
**Vendor:** Zohocorp  
**Product:** ManageEngine ADSelfServicePlus  
**Versions Affected:** Before 5.5 build 5517  
**Researcher:** Jason Juntunen aka @missing0x00 (https://github.com/missing0x00)  
**CVSS:** 8.8  

## Description
The custom GINA/CP module in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus before 5.5 build 5517 allows remote attackers to execute code and escalate privileges via spoofing.
It does not authenticate the intended server before opening a browser window. An unauthenticated attacker capable of conducting a spoofing attack can redirect the browser to gain execution in the context of the WinLogon.exe process. If Network Level Authentication is not enforced, the vulnerability can be exploited via RDP.
Additionally, if the web server has a misconfigured certificate then no spoofing attack is required.

### Proof of Concept
1. Conduct spoofing attack using any available method (ARP, physical access, etc.), redirecting traffic intended for the intended ADSSP server
2. Run web server on attacking host, serving binary junk file named AgentStatusUpdate.cc
3. RDP to target host (if NLA is not enforced - otherwise this attack requires physical access)
4. Click "Reset Password" link or tile on logon screen
5. Built-in client browser will be redirected to web server on attacking host, opening File Download dialog
6. Click Save, opening File Explorer dialog
7. Shift+Right-Click > "Open command window here"
