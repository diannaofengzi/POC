# CVE-2012-5958

Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique_service_name function in ssdp/ssdp_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a UDP packet with a crafted string that is not properly handled after a certain pointer subtraction. Per CERT's advisory additional products may be affected: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681

"Hundreds of vendors have used the libupnp library in their products, many of which are acting as the home routers for consumer networks. Any application linking to libupnp is likely to be affected"
