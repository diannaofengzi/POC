## Readme

> [Suggested description]
> lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may
> allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a
> protected directory tree, because "Failed to open" often indicates
> that a file does not exist, whereas "does not refer to a network
> namespace path" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is
> different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was
> based on the premise that "we will report back to the user that the
> open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed";
> however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for
> failing except that the file does not exist.
