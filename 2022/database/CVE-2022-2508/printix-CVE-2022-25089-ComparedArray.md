## About The Project

![Screen Shot](printixPost.png)

An "Incorrect Use of a Privileged API" vulnerability in PrintixService.exe, in Printix's "Printix Secure Cloud Print Management", Version 1.3.1106.0 and below allows a Local Or Remote attacker the ability change all HKEY Windows Registry values as SYSTEM context via the UITasks.PersistentRegistryData parameter.

Here's why this is a big issue:

* This CVE allows anyone to connect to your corporate network and change any registry value that they please on the remote computer.
* Any user logged in (regardless of their user role) is able to target themselves, or have someone remotely systematically change all registry values on the machine.
* There is practically no way to check for the machine but a method to check if a machine has been compromised will be released soon.

Any machine that has any version of Printix installed (<= 1.3.1106.0 as of 3/1/2022) is highly vulnerable to this exploit. A patch could be released within a couple months, yet this may take even longer due to how embedded this command is inside their API, and how their entire authentication framework has to be changed.

This was discovered on 10/2/2021, and a CVE was reserved on 3/1/2022.
