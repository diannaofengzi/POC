## Readme

# TLDR
This is a brief report of a vulnerability (CVE-2019-12489) discovered playing around with a Fastgate modem/router of Fastweb and Ghidra.
The vulnerability allow the execution of a command injection through an http request and can be used to enable an SSH shell.

# Firmware collection and extraction

All the firmware files are located in http://59.0.121.191:8080/ACS-server/file/FILENAME

Where FILENAME is equal to: 
* 0.00.89_FW_200_Askey
* 0.00.81_FW_200_Askey
* 0.00.67_FW_200_Askey
* 0.00.47_FW_200_Askey
* 0.00.267_FW_200_Askey
* 0.00.167_FW_200_Askey

So, for example, to obtain the last firware just go to http://59.0.121.191:8080/ACS-server/file/0.00.89_FW_200_Askey

To exctract the files we need the utility in https://github.com/nlitsme/ubidump (this is the first one that worked for me).

Doing a `binwalk` on the file gives us:

```console
$ binwalk 0.00.89_FW_200_Askey

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
94            0x5E            JFFS2 filesystem, little endian
3276894       0x32005E        UBI erase count header, version: 1, EC: 0x0, VID header offset: 0x800, data offset: 0x1000
```

We don't need the JFFS2 filesystem, only the UBI part. To do that we can cut the file using `dd`.
To do that we need the total dimension and the UBI starting point.

The file dimension can be retrieved using ls:

```console
$ ls -la

total 55836
drwxr-xr-x  3 riccardo users     4096 set 24 10:07 .
drwx------ 83 riccardo users    12288 set 24 10:08 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 riccardo users 57147506 set 24 10:05 0.00.89_FW_200_Askey
```
The value ***57147506*** is what we need.
Looking at the output of `binwalk` we can see that the UBI part is starting at ***3276894***. With these two values we can use `dd` like this:

```console
$ dd if=0.00.89_FW_200_Askey of=0.00.89_FW_200_Askey.UBI bs=1 skip=3276894 count=57147506
```

Now we can use ubidump (after some initial configuration depending on the system config):

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/nlitsme/ubidump.git
$ sudo pip install crcmod
$ yay -S python-lzo
$ python ubidump/ubidump.py -s bump 0.00.89_FW_200_Askey.UBI
```

We now have the filesystem in `bump/rootfs_ubifs/`

Now we can proceed a bit further in the analysis.

# Analysis

Looking around in the filesystem we can see that the web gui is managed by mini_httpd:

```console
$ grep -i -r "mini_httpd"
etc/sniproxy/urlfilter3.sh:ln -sf /usr/sbin/mini_httpd $URLFILTER_WEBD_PATH 
etc/sniproxy/urlfilter3.sh:$URLFILTER_WEBD_PATH -d $URLFILTER_WEB_PATH -c "**.cgi" -u admin -S -E /web/mini_httpd.pem -p $webd_https_port 
bin/web.sh:#mv /tmp/mini_httpd /usr/sbin 
bin/web.sh:killall -9 mini_httpd 
bin/web.sh:mini_httpd -d /web -c "STATUSAPI/**.cgi|STATUSAPI/*" -u admin -T "UTF-8" -p 8080
```

And we can see that mini_httpd depends on a .cgi file:

```console
$ grep -i -r "status.cgi"
web/factory/mtcmd/mt_info.htm:          "url":"/status.cgi", 
web/fw-router/app/app.js:.value('apiServiceUrl', '/status.cgi') 
**web/js/status.js:var CGI_NAME='status.cgi';**
web/js/status.js:       "url":"http://192.168.101.93/STATUSAPI/status.cgi",
web/js/status.js:       "url":"http://192.168.101.93/STATUSAPI/status.cgi",
web/js/status.js:       "url":http://192.168.101.93/STATUSAPI/status.cgi,
```

So, using Ghidra, we can start looking in the `status.cgi`

Skipping a lot of details, the vulnerability is described below.

# Expoit

The first thing to look is for a main method like the one in this picture:

![Image of main](images/main.png)

We can see that setup is called. After a bit of looking around ***run_service(...)*** seems the core of all the functionalities.

![Image of setup](images/setup.png)

Looking for ***&service_tab*** we can see that some specific strings are linked to actual code executed by ***run_service(...)***

![Image of services](images/services.png)

After looking at these methods one by one I stubmle accross ***usb_remove***

![Image of usbremove](images/usbremove.png)

In details:
```c
mountVal = (char *)find_val(httpparams,"mount");
```
Takes the string in the url request directly in a variable
```c
sprintf((char *)&mountLocation,"/mnt/%s",mountVal);
```
Create a complete path given the parameter in the URL request
```c
mountLocation
```
mountLocation is directly used in a command

Now, there are checks to prevent command injection. In particular:
```c
invalidChars = 0x60273b7c;
```
Is used to check for some invalid characters like \` ' ; | but ***\&*** is not present in the list so if the parameter mount is equal to `&ping -c 10 192.168.1.172&` the check will result allow the execution of `/statusapi/bin/umount -lf &ping -c 10 192.168.1.172&`.

The mount command will fail but the following ping will be executed.

# The official path
The patch published simplifies the code eliminating the checks for special characters by simply checking if the folder exists.
