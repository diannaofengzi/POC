## Readme

# Hydra 0.1.8

[Hydra](http://hydra.hellug.gr/) is a lightweight, multithreaded HTTP(S) server based on [Boa](https://github.com/shrug-security/boa-0.94.13) which is occasionally still found in embedded firmware images for serving CGI scripts, files, and more. 0.1.8 is the last stable version, and was released [in 2006](http://hydra.hellug.gr/download/).

Links: [disclosure](https://gist.github.com/fxb6476/0b9883a88ff2ca40de46a8469834e16c).
