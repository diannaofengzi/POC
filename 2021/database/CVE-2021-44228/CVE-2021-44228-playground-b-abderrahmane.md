# LOG4SHELL-CVE-2021-44228-Validator

[![Basic test](https://github.com/b-abderrahmane/CVE-2021-44228-playground/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/b-abderrahmane/CVE-2021-44228-playground/actions/workflows/main.yml)


[![Extended test](https://github.com/b-abderrahmane/CVE-2021-44228-playground/actions/workflows/extended-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/b-abderrahmane/CVE-2021-44228-playground/actions/workflows/extended-test.yml)

## About
This tool allows you to verify whether a simple Java web app is vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 for a user provided version of Java and of Log4J.
You can also [optionally] apply one of a view pre-defined mitigations.
The simulation lab spun up by `log4shell_validator.py` uses docker-compose to simulate exploiting the log4j vulnerability and gaining RCE on the vulnerable machine.

## The way it works

First of all, some docker images need to be built. The `./build_images.sh` script should take care of that.

Ths attack simulation is done in the following way:
- First a simple Java web application is spun up on a container on port 8080. When this application receives GET calls on `/2021-44228-via-message` it always logs the User-Agent header field. The code for this application is available under `./poc_template`
- A Fake LDAP server is spun up using [marshalsec](https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec) on a separate container on port 1389. (This container will forward received LDAP requests to the Nginx server)
- A Nginx web server is spun up on port 8888, this container hosts the compiled .class file we want to run on our vulnerable app.
- A simple curl container is started, this one runs the `./exploit.sh` script which sends a payload to the vulnerable app.

## Instructions

- Make sure python, docker, docker-compose and maven are available locally.
- Build the marshalsec jar file by running: `cd marshalsec/ ;mvn clean package -DskipTests ;cd -`
- Run `./build-images.sh`
- Run `python log4shell_validator.py  --java-version 8 --log4j-version 2.12.1`

## Usage examples

- Python wrapper help text:
```
~/workspace/CVE-2021-44228-playground$ python log4shell_validator.py --help
usage: log4shell_validator.py [-h] [--java-version JAVA_VERSION] --log4j-version LOG4J_VERSION [--no-cleanup] [--disable-trust-url] [--remove-jndi-lookup-class] [--disable-message-lookup] [--debug]
                              [--exploit-via-thread-context]

log4j-vulnerability-tester

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --java-version JAVA_VERSION
                        version of java to be used
  --log4j-version LOG4J_VERSION
                        version of log4j to be used
  --no-cleanup          Don't delete used containers.
  --disable-trust-url   Disable the LDAP trustURLCodebase setting on the victim app
  --remove-jndi-lookup-class
                        Remove the JNDI Lookup class from the log4j jar file
  --disable-message-lookup
                        Disable the JNDI message lookup in the victim app's JVM
  --debug               Display all container's logs
  --exploit-via-thread-context
                        By sending the payload to an HTTP handler which makes use of Custom logging with ThreadContext, attempt to bypass the no-message-lookup mitigation
```
## Available features:

This validator has been tested with several combinations of Java7/8 and different versions of Log4J2, for more examples please see the extended tests pipeline in the github actions tab.

For now, the following mitigations have been implemented:
- Disabling trustURLCodebase for LDAP by setting the propery 1com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` to False.
- Removing JNDILookup.class file from the log4j jar file.
- Disabling message lookup by providing the following flag to the JVM: `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True`

In addition to that, a new flag has been added to test an exploitation vector which can bypass disabling message lookups: `--exploit-via-thread-context`
