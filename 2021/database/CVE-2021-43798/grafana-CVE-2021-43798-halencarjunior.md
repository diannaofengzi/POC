## Workarounds

All installations between v8.0.0-beta1 and v8.3.0 should be upgraded as soon as possible.

If you cannot upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. For example, the normalize_path setting in envoy.

Thanks to our defense-in-depth approach, Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability.

As always, we closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Pro. They have received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. In alphabetical order, this is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure Managed Grafana.
