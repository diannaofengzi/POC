# CVE-2021-24307

The All in One SEO – Best WordPress SEO Plugin – Easily Improve Your SEO Rankings before 4.1.0.2 enables authenticated users with "aioseo_tools_settings" privilege (most of the time admin) to execute arbitrary code on the underlying host. Users can restore plugin's configuration by uploading a backup .ini file in the section "Tool > Import/Export". However, the plugin attempts to unserialize values of the .ini file. Moreover, the plugin embeds Monolog library which can be used to craft a gadget chain and thus trigger system command execution.
