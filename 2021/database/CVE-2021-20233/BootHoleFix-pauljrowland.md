# Boot Hole Fix

This script will remediate the BootHole bug identified in CVE-2020-25632 and/or CVE-2021-20233.

On July 29, 2020, Microsoft published security advisory 200011 that describes a new vulnerability that's related to Secure Boot.

Devices that trust the Microsoft third-party Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Certificate Authority (CA) in their Secure Boot configuration may be susceptible to an attacker who has administrative privileges or physical access to the device.

This script is to apply the latest Secure Boot DBX revocation list to invalidate the vulnerable modules.
