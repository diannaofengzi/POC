# CVE-2021-45416
Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RosarioSIS 8.2.1 allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML via the search_term parameter in the modules/Scheduling/Courses.php script.

- Vendor: francoisjacquet
- Vendor Website: https://www.rosariosis.org/
- Affected Product: RosarioSIS
- Affected Versions: v8.2.1, however it is _assumed_ earlier versions might be affected as well

---

### Instructions to reproduce: 
- Use RosarioSIS 8.2.1.
- Open the URL vulnerable to XSS: http://localhost/rosariosis/Modules.php?modname=misc/ChooseCourse.php&modfunc=choose_course&course_modfunc=search&last_year=&search_term=%22%20onfocus%3D%22alert%28%60XSS%60%29 (make sure to replace localhost/rosariosis with your web server's path)
- **Note that this website needs to be opened in a popup, for example using the javascript window.open() method. A proof of concept code is available in this repo.**

### Cause
User-supplied input in the search_term parameter is improperly neutralized in the modules/Scheduling/Courses.php script, which is accessible through ChooseCourse.php and ChooseRequest.php as shown in the proof of concept that you can find in this repo.

### Solution
Update to the latest version of RosarioSIS. This issue was fixed in version v8.3.
