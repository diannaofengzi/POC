## Exploit
 - Take WordPress services offline through automating a long password attack

    - The lack of additional security measures such as CAPTCHAs
    
## Solution
 - Update WordPress to >5.0.1

## Features
 - Automate the takedown of a WordPress site
 - Can run in headless or verbose mode
 - Optimised significantly from version 1 (not available on GitHub)

## Requirements and Installation
 - Requires the WordPress version to be <5.0.1
 - [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/)
 - Linux (tested)
 - Install all dependencies from the requirements.txt file. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Arguments

#### Required arguments:
  - `T` || `--target`
    - Specify IP address or URL of the WordPress machine.
	- If an IP address is specified, the script constructs a URL (http://{IP_Address}/wp-admin)
	- If a URL is specified, the script does not construct a URL.

#### Optional arguments:
  - `--attempts`
    - Specify the number of attempts before the script ends.
    - Default: 500
    - **NOTE:** Script automatically ends after 5 failed attempts.

  - `--attempts`
    - Specify the number of attempts before the script ends.
    - Default: 500
    - **NOTE:** Script automatically ends after 5 failed attempts.
  
  
  - `--length`
    - Specify the base length of the password entry.
    - Default: 1000000
    
    
  - `-nF` || `--noFeedback`
    - This disables the output of the username & password entries instead, just showing whether the attempt completed / failed.
    - Default: Disabled
  
  
  - `-V` || `--verbose`
    - Flag for the program not to run in headless mode. This launches a browser and shows every action.
    - Default: Disabled
  
  
  - `--version`
    - Display program version

## Usage
 - Run 'wp_kill.py' in terminal with arguments (see above)
